          We provide free training for women who live in poor rural households, to help them discover income-generating opportunities and enhance their living standards. 
          
          
          In addition, we will also teach them entrepreneur skill and donate the equipments so they can apply their new skill to generate more income and potentially teach other women.

      - title: First empowerment program
        content: >-
          Our first empowerment program will be done in an Islamic boarding school, located in a small village in Bojonegoro, East Java. There are 20 girls (age 8-15) from low income families, live and study in this Islamic boarding school.
      
          Many girls in the area will usually get married right after finishing the school (aged 15-17), this makes them vulnerable to gender-based violence and prevent them to enter the paid labour force and gaining economic self-sufficiency.

In this zoom webinar series, we will talk about:

*   Post-grad blues (it's too real, and why is nobody talking about it?)

*   How to pursue your passion if you don't know what it is? Or if you have too many?Â 

*   Which master degree should you take? Now or later? Is it actually necessary for you?

          We provide free training for women who live in poor rural households,
          to help them discover income-generating opportunities and enhance
          their living standards.


          In addition, we will also teach them entrepreneur skill and donate the
          equipments so they can apply their new skill to generate more income
          and potentially teach other women.


          **The goal of the program is to support women to become independents
          and to give them opportunity to support themselves or their family
          financially.**
